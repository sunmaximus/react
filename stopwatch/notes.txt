State is an object a that we use to keep track and respond to user input
Each component has it own instance of state.
New component will have it own state.
When ever we update our state it causes our component and any nested component
to re-render. This is how we update our view with new data in the app.
When we use state in a component we should initialize it a reasonable value.
